# Bubble shooter
This repository showcases a Bubble Shooter Game, which is a Unity project providing a unique and challenging experience for both players and developers alike.

Unlike other bubble shooter games that rely solely on colors, the explosions of bubbles in this game are triggered by another mechanic! Each bubble is assigned a specific score, and bubbles with the same score merge together through multiplication. This process continues until the score reaches 2048, at which point the bubble and its neighbors finally bump up. This feature sets this game apart from others and provides players with an engaging gameplay experience.

To enhance the visual appeal, custom shaders are used throughout the game. These shaders provide dynamic effects such as bubble transparency, glowing effects during bubble merges, and smooth animations that make the gameplay more immersive. The use of shaders adds a layer of polish, helping to bring out the colorful explosions and fluid motion that are core to the Bubble Shooter experience.

The challenge posed by this project was significant, serving as an excellent opportunity for learning and experiencing the completion of a live game and minor updates.
