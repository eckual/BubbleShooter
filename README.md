Welcome to the Bubble Shooter game, a Unity project that offers a unique and challenging experience for both players and developers alike.

Why & How?
Unlike other bubble shooter games that rely solely on color, the explosions of bubbles in this game are triggered by another mechanic.

Each bubble is assigned a specific score, and bubbles with the same number merge together through multiplication. This process continues until the score reaches 2048, at which point the bubble and its neighbors finally bump up.
This feature sets this game apart from others and provides players with an engaging gameplay experience.
