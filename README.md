# Bubble shooter
This repository showcases a Bubble Shooter game, which is a Unity project providing a unique and challenging experience for both players and developers alike.

Unlike other bubble shooter games that rely solely on color, the explosions of bubbles in this game are triggered by another mechanic, Each bubble is assigned a specific score, and bubbles with the same score merge together through multiplication. This process continues until the score reaches 2048, at which point the bubble and its neighbors finally bump up. This feature sets this game apart from others and provides players with an engaging gameplay experience.

The challenge posed by this project was significant, serving an excellent chance for learning and experiencing the game's completion.
